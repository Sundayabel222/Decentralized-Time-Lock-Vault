# 🔒 Decentralized Time-Lock Vault

A production-ready Soroban smart contract on the Stellar blockchain that locks XLM or any Stellar asset until a future timestamp is reached.

---

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Network | Stellar (Soroban) |
| Language | Rust |
| SDK | soroban-sdk v22 |
| Storage | Persistent (per-depositor) |
| Max deposit | 10^15 units (1 quadrillion) |
| Max lock duration | 5 years |

---

## How It Works

1. A user calls `deposit(token, amount, unlock_time)` — tokens transfer from their wallet into the contract.
2. The contract stores a `VaultEntry` in **Persistent Storage** keyed by the depositor's address.
3. When the user calls `withdraw()`, the contract checks `env.ledger().timestamp() >= unlock_time`.
4. If the time has passed, tokens are returned. Otherwise the call fails with `FundsStillLocked`.
5. An admin can perform emergency withdrawals (funds always return to the depositor, never to the admin).
6. Admin rights can be transferred via a two-step process, or permanently renounced to make the vault fully trustless.

---

## Architecture

### Deposit / Withdraw Flow

```
Depositor
   │
   ├─► deposit(token, amount, unlock_time)
   │       │
   │       ├─ validate amount & unlock_time
   │       ├─ token.transfer(depositor → contract)
   │       ├─ storage::set_deposit(VaultKey::Deposit(depositor) → VaultEntry)
   │       └─ emit "deposit" event
   │
   └─► withdraw(depositor)
           │
           ├─ load VaultEntry
           ├─ assert now >= unlock_time
           ├─ storage::remove_deposit(depositor)   ← state cleared first (CEI)
           ├─ token.transfer(contract → depositor)
           └─ emit "withdraw" event
```

### Storage Layout

```
Persistent Storage
├── VaultKey::Admin                    → Address
│       (set once on initialize; removed on renounce_admin)
│
├── VaultKey::PendingAdmin             → Address
│       (set by transfer_admin; cleared by accept_admin / cancel_transfer_admin)
│
└── VaultKey::Deposit(depositor: Address) → VaultEntry
        ├── token:       Address   (SEP-41 token contract)
        ├── amount:      i128      (locked units)
        ├── unlock_time: u64       (Unix seconds)
        └── depositor:   Address   (owner; stored for event emission)
```

All entries use TTL bump threshold ≈ 30 days and target ≈ 5.2 years so a max-duration deposit cannot expire before its unlock time.

## Contract API

### Initialization

#### `initialize(admin: Address, max_deposit: Option<i128>, max_lock_secs: Option<u64>)`
Sets the admin address. Optionally overrides the compile-time limits for this deployment. Pass `None` to use the defaults (`10^15` and `5 years`). Must be called once after deployment.

---

### Core

#### `deposit(depositor, token, amount, unlock_time, penalty_bps)`
Locks `amount` of `token` until `unlock_time` (Unix seconds).

| Param | Type | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| `depositor` | `Address` | Must sign |
| `token` | `Address` | SEP-41 token contract |
| `amount` | `i128` | `0 < amount ≤ 10^15` |
| `unlock_time` | `u64` | `now < unlock_time ≤ now + 5 years` |
| `penalty_bps` | `u32` | `0–10000` (basis points for early-exit penalty) |

#### `cancel_deposit(depositor)`
Cancels an active deposit before the unlock time. The penalty (`penalty_bps` set at deposit time) is sent to the `fee_recipient`; the remainder is returned to the depositor. Fails with `FundsStillLocked` if the vault is already past its unlock time (use `withdraw` instead).

#### `withdraw(depositor)`
Withdraws funds if `now >= unlock_time`. Fails with `FundsStillLocked` otherwise.

---

### Admin

#### `emergency_withdraw(admin, depositor)`
Admin-only. Returns funds to the depositor regardless of lock time. Funds always go to the depositor — never to the admin.

#### `batch_emergency_withdraw(admin, depositors) → Vec<WithdrawResult>`
Admin-only. Processes emergency withdrawals for multiple depositors in a single transaction — useful for contract migrations where many depositors need recovery at once.

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `Address` | Must be the current admin. Signs **once** for the entire batch. |
| `depositors` | `Vec<Address>` | Addresses to process. Max `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (25) entries. |

**Best-effort**: depositors with no active deposit are skipped and recorded as `success: false` in the result — the call never aborts due to a missing deposit, so all valid entries are always processed.

**Returns** `Vec<WithdrawResult>` — one entry per input address:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `depositor` | `Address` | The input address |
| `success` | `bool` | `true` = funds transferred; `false` = no deposit found, skipped |

**Instruction budget**: Soroban caps each transaction at ~100M instructions. Each iteration costs roughly 1–2M instructions (two storage removes, one token transfer, one event). The hard cap of 25 keeps the batch well within budget. For larger sets, page through depositors with `get_depositors(offset, limit)` and call this function multiple times.

#### `transfer_admin(admin, new_admin)`
Step 1 of a two-step admin transfer. Nominates `new_admin` as pending admin.

#### `accept_admin(new_admin)`
Step 2. The pending admin accepts and becomes the active admin.

#### `cancel_transfer_admin(admin)`
Cancels a pending admin transfer. Only the current admin can cancel.

#### `renounce_admin(admin)`
Permanently removes admin privileges. After this call, `emergency_withdraw` and all admin functions are disabled forever. Makes the vault fully trustless.

---

### Read-only Queries

#### `get_vault(depositor) → Option<VaultEntry>`
Returns the current vault entry. Does **not** bump storage TTL (no extra fees).

#### `get_vault_with_time_remaining(depositor) → Option<(VaultEntry, u64)>`
Returns `Some((entry, seconds_remaining))` if a deposit exists, or `None`. Combines `get_vault` and `time_remaining` into a single RPC call.

#### `time_remaining(depositor) → u64`
Returns seconds until unlock. Returns `0` if unlocked or no deposit exists. Does **not** bump TTL.

#### `has_deposit(depositor) → bool`
Returns `true` if `depositor` has an active deposit. Cheaper than `get_vault` — no `VaultEntry` deserialization.

#### `get_time() → u64`
Returns the current ledger timestamp.

#### `get_admin() → Option<Address>`
Returns the current admin, or `None` if renounced.

#### `get_pending_admin() → Option<Address>`
Returns the pending admin during a transfer, or `None`.

#### `is_admin(address) → bool`
Returns `true` if `address` is the current admin. Returns `false` if admin has been renounced.

#### `get_fee_recipient() → Option<Address>`
Returns the fee recipient address set at initialization.

#### `get_constants() → (i128, u64)`
Returns the effective `(MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT, MAX_LOCK_DURATION_SECS)` for this deployment — runtime-configured values if set at `initialize`, otherwise the compile-time defaults.

#### `get_depositor_count() → u32`
Returns the total number of addresses with an active deposit.

#### `get_depositors(offset: u32, limit: u32) → Vec<Address>`
Returns a paginated slice of active depositor addresses.

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `offset` | `u32` | Zero-based start index |
| `limit` | `u32` | Maximum number of addresses to return |

Use `offset=0, limit=N` for the first page, then increment `offset` by `N` for subsequent pages.

---

## Events

All events are emitted via `env.events().publish(topics, data)`.

| Event | Topics | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `deposit` | `("deposit", depositor, token)` | `(deposit_id, amount, unlock_time)` |
| `withdraw` | `("withdraw", depositor, token)` | `(deposit_id, amount)` |
| `emrg_wdraw` | `("emrg_wdraw", admin, depositor)` | `(deposit_id, token, amount)` |
| `dep_cancel` | `("dep_cancel", depositor, token)` | `(amount, penalty)` |
| `adm_xfr_init` | `("adm_xfr_init", current_admin)` | `pending_admin` |
| `adm_xfr_done` | `("adm_xfr_done", new_admin)` | `()` |
| `adm_renounce` | `("adm_renounce", former_admin)` | `()` |

All `amount` and `penalty` values are `i128` token units. `deposit_id` is a `u32` per-depositor sequence number.

---

## Storage Layout

All entries use **Persistent Storage** with TTL bump threshold ≈ 30 days (`BUMP_THRESHOLD = 518_400` ledgers) and target ≈ 5.2 years (`BUMP_TARGET = 33_000_000` ledgers), ensuring a max-duration deposit cannot expire before its unlock time.

| Key | Type | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| `VaultKey::Admin` | `Address` | Set on `initialize`; removed on `renounce_admin` |
| `VaultKey::PendingAdmin` | `Address` | Set by `transfer_admin`; cleared by `accept_admin` / `cancel_transfer_admin` |
| `VaultKey::Initialized` | `bool` | Set once on `initialize`; never removed |
| `VaultKey::FeeRecipient` | `Address` | Set on `initialize`; never removed |
| `VaultKey::MaxDeposit` | `i128` | Set on `initialize` if overridden; absent means use compile-time default |
| `VaultKey::MaxLockSecs` | `u64` | Set on `initialize` if overridden; absent means use compile-time default |
| `VaultKey::DepositCounter(depositor)` | `u32` | Incremented on each `deposit`; never decremented |
| `VaultKey::Deposit(depositor, id)` | `VaultEntry` | Created on `deposit`; removed on `withdraw` / `emergency_withdraw` / `cancel_deposit` |
| `VaultKey::DepositorList` | `Vec<Address>` | Updated on `deposit` and `withdraw` |

`VaultEntry` fields: `token: Address`, `amount: i128`, `unlock_time: u64`, `depositor: Address`, `penalty_bps: u32`.

TTL is bumped on every **write**. Read-only query functions (`get_vault`, `time_remaining`, `get_time`) skip the TTL bump to avoid charging callers extra fees.

## Error Codes

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `InvalidAmount` | Amount ≤ 0 |
| 2 | `UnlockTimeNotInFuture` | `unlock_time` ≤ current ledger time |
| 3 | `NoDepositFound` | No active deposit for this address |
| 4 | `FundsStillLocked` | Lock period not yet expired |
| 5 | `DepositAlreadyExists` | Must withdraw before re-depositing |
| 6 | `LockDurationTooLong` | Lock period exceeds 5 years |
| 7 | `Unauthorized` | Caller is not the admin |
| 8 | `AmountTooLarge` | Amount exceeds 10^15 |
| 9 | `InvalidPenaltyBps` | `penalty_bps` > 10000 |
| 10 | `LockDurationTooShort` | Lock period is shorter than the minimum (60 s) |
| 11 | `InvalidAdmin` | Nominated admin is the same as the current admin |
| 12 | `BatchTooLarge` | `depositors.len()` exceeds `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (25) |

---

## Security Properties

| Property | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Checks-Effects-Interactions | Storage cleared before token transfer on every withdrawal |
| Auth-first ordering | `require_auth()` is always the first statement in every mutating function |
| No re-entrancy surface | State removed before any external token call |
| Bounded inputs | Amount capped at 10^15; lock duration capped at 5 years |
| No admin fund theft | Emergency withdraw always sends to depositor, never to admin |
| Trustless mode | Admin can permanently renounce via `renounce_admin()` |
| Safe admin transfer | Two-step transfer prevents accidental key loss |
| TTL management | Persistent entries bumped to ~1 year on every write; view functions skip TTL bump |
| No testutils in production | `features = ["testutils"]` only in `[dev-dependencies]` |
| Initialize front-running | `initialize()` has no on-chain guard against a race: an attacker who observes the deploy transaction in the mempool can call `initialize` first with their own address. **Mitigation:** always call `initialize` in the same transaction as `deploy` (atomic deploy+init) so no intermediate state is visible. The deploy script does this by default. |

---

## Upgradeability

Soroban contracts are **immutable by default** — once deployed, the contract code cannot be changed or patched.

| Implication | Detail |
|---|---|
| No in-place upgrades | There is no `upgrade` or `set_code` function; the deployed WASM is fixed forever |
| Bug fixes require redeployment | A new contract must be deployed and users must migrate their funds to it |
| Migration path | The admin can call `emergency_withdraw(admin, depositor)` for each active deposit to return funds to depositors, who can then re-deposit into the new contract |
| Trustless trade-off | If `renounce_admin()` has been called, no migration is possible — the contract is fully trustless but also fully immutable with no escape hatch |

Plan deployments carefully. Audit the contract before going to mainnet, because there is no way to patch a live deployment.

---

## Known Limitations

- **One active deposit per address in the documented flow.** The README and error model describe deposits as address-keyed entries, so a depositor should withdraw or cancel the current vault entry before opening another one.
- **No partial withdrawals.** A withdrawal or emergency withdrawal returns the full stored amount for the vault entry; the contract does not expose an amount parameter for withdrawing only part of a deposit.
- **No early user withdrawal.** Standard `withdraw` only succeeds once `unlock_time` has passed. Early exits must use the explicit cancellation flow where configured, or the admin emergency path.
- **Single-admin control.** Admin functions are controlled by one admin address at a time. The contract supports two-step admin transfer and renouncing admin rights, but it does not implement native multisig approval.
- **Storage TTL requires operational monitoring for long locks.** Persistent entries are bumped during writes, but long-lived deployments should monitor TTL assumptions so maximum-duration locks remain recoverable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add WASM target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install Soroban CLI
cargo install --locked soroban-cli

# Install cargo-watch (optional, for make watch)
cargo install cargo-watch
```

### Build

```bash
make build
```

> **Why not just `cargo build`?**
> Running `cargo build` without `--target wasm32-unknown-unknown` produces a native binary, not a WASM contract. The Makefile's `build` target always passes the correct flag. A `.cargo/config.toml` is included in the repo that documents this trade-off — the default target is intentionally left commented out because setting it would break `cargo test` (tests must run natively to use Soroban testutils).

### Test

```bash
make test
```

> Tests run natively (no `--target` flag) so that `soroban-sdk`'s `testutils` feature works. Never run `cargo test --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

### Full CI check (fmt + lint + test + audit + deny)

```bash
make check
```

### Security audit

```bash
make audit
```

Runs `cargo audit` to check all dependencies against the [RustSec Advisory Database](https://rustsec.org/).

### License & dependency policy

```bash
make deny
```

Runs `cargo deny check` to enforce license allowlists and ban policies defined in `deny.toml`.

### Optimize WASM

```bash
make optimize
```

### Check WASM size

```bash
make check-wasm-size
```

Fails if the optimized WASM exceeds `MAX_WASM_BYTES` (default **65 536 bytes / 64 KB**).
Override the threshold at the command line:

```bash
make check-wasm-size MAX_WASM_BYTES=81920   # 80 KB
```

The same threshold is enforced in CI via the `Check WASM size` step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
To update the limit, change `MAX_WASM_BYTES` in both places (or only in `ci.yml` if you don't use the Makefile target locally).

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
export SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY=S...
make deploy-testnet
```

### Release Deployment (CI)

Pushing a version tag triggers the `deploy-testnet` CI job automatically:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The job requires the `SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY` secret to be set in the repository's **testnet** environment (`Settings → Environments → testnet → Secrets`). After the run, the deployed contract ID appears in the job's summary tab.

### Smoke Test (local node)

Runs a quick end-to-end test against a local Soroban standalone node — no funded account or testnet access required.

```bash
# Build the WASM first, then run the smoke test
make smoke-test-local
```

The script (`scripts/smoke_test_local.sh`):
1. Starts a local node via `stellar network start local`
2. Generates a funded test identity
3. Deploys the contract and calls `initialize`, `deposit`, `get_vault`, `time_remaining`, and `withdraw`
4. Asserts expected outputs at each step
5. Stops the local node on exit

---

## Updating the Stellar CLI Version

`STELLAR_CLI_VERSION` is defined as a top-level `env` variable in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Dependabot keeps GitHub Actions versions up to date automatically, but it does not track arbitrary binary downloads. When a new `stellar-cli` release is published at https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/releases, update the variable manually:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
env:
  STELLAR_CLI_VERSION: "<new-version>"
```

## Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist when deploying to production.

- [ ] Deploy and call `initialize` in the same transaction to prevent front-running
- [ ] Verify `get_admin` returns the expected admin address
- [ ] Run `get_constants` to confirm `MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` and `MAX_LOCK_DURATION_SECS` match your intended parameters
- [ ] Verify `get_fee_recipient` returns the correct fee recipient address
- [ ] Consider calling `renounce_admin` for fully trustless operation once setup is complete
- [ ] Monitor storage TTL for long-duration vaults — entries are bumped on write but not on read
- [ ] Confirm the optimized WASM size is within the Stellar network limit (`make check-wasm-size`)
## Fee Estimation

Soroban charges fees for persistent storage operations. Here is what each call costs at a high level:

| Operation | Storage effect |
|---|---|
| `deposit` | Creates a new persistent entry + pays for initial TTL bump (~30-day threshold, ~5.2-year target) |
| `withdraw` / `cancel_deposit` / `emergency_withdraw` | Removes the persistent entry (storage freed) |
| `get_vault`, `time_remaining`, `get_time` | Read-only — **no TTL bump**, no extra storage fee |
| `initialize` | Writes admin / fee-recipient entries once |

Key points:
- The depositor pays the storage-creation fee on `deposit`.
- View functions intentionally skip TTL bumps to avoid charging callers for reads.
- For very long locks (approaching 5 years) the TTL is set well beyond the unlock time, so no manual TTL extension is needed.

For current fee rates see the [Stellar fee documentation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/fees-resource-limits-metering).

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Detail |
|---|---|
| One deposit per address | A depositor must `withdraw` or `cancel_deposit` before making a new deposit. |
| No partial withdrawals | The full locked amount is returned in one call; partial releases are not supported. |
| No early withdrawal without admin | Only `cancel_deposit` (with a penalty) or an admin `emergency_withdraw` can release funds before the unlock time. |
| Single admin address | Admin is one key — no multisig or DAO governance. Use `renounce_admin` to go fully trustless. |
| Storage TTL | Persistent entries are bumped to ~5.2 years on every write. Deposits longer than that would require a TTL extension call (current max lock is 5 years, so this is not an issue in practice). |

---

## Testing

### Run all tests

```bash
make test
```

### Run a specific test

```bash
cargo test test_deposit_success --features testutils -- --nocapture
```

### Run all tests with output

```bash
cargo test --features testutils -- --nocapture
```

> Tests run natively (without `--target wasm32-unknown-unknown`) so that `soroban-sdk`'s `testutils` feature works correctly.

### Test categories

The suite (`contracts/time-lock-vault/src/test.rs`) contains 48+ tests covering:

| Category | What is tested |
|---|---|
| Deposit | Valid deposits, duplicate deposits, amount/time boundary checks |
| Withdraw | Successful withdrawal, early withdrawal rejection, missing deposit |
| Cancel deposit | Penalty calculation, fee recipient transfer, post-unlock rejection |
| Admin | `transfer_admin`, `accept_admin`, `cancel_transfer_admin`, `renounce_admin` |
| Emergency withdraw | Admin-only access, funds always go to depositor |
| Read-only queries | `get_vault`, `time_remaining`, `get_time`, `get_constants`, pagination |
| Error codes | Every `VaultError` variant is exercised |

---

## Use Cases

- **Savings accounts** — Lock funds for a fixed period to enforce saving discipline.
- **Token vesting** — Team or investor tokens released on a schedule.
- **HODL challenges** — Commit to not selling until a future date.
- **Escrow** — Time-gated release of payment.
